To Do List Manager
==================

Summary
-------
This is a project originally created to learn Ruby on Rails. I've decided to revisit this app in order to turn it into an API with an Ember.js front end.

Functionality includes:
* create task,
* edit task,
* destroy task,
* and the ability to mark a task as done without deleting it.
